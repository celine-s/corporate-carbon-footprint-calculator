### Code Quality

#### Automated Tools

We use a set of tools for a reasonably high code quality.

1. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for Code Formatting `npm run prettier`
2. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for Code Guidelines `npm run lint`
<!-- 3. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for Static Type Checking (done by Next)

These checks are also run on every merge request, and each of these must pass for the MR to be mergable. -->
