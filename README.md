## Setup

### Code Quality

#### Automated Tools

We use a set of tools for a reasonably high code quality.

1. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for Code Formatting `npm run prettier`
2. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for Code Guidelines `npm run lint`
<!-- 3. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for Static Type Checking (done by Next)

These checks are also run on every merge request, and each of these must pass for the MR to be mergable. -->

## Running locally with Storybook

```sh
npm ci
npm run storybook
```

If new components are added make sure the component gets exported properly through the `index.ts` files in the respective folders. The `index.ts` files can be generated using:

```sh
npm run generate-index-files
```
